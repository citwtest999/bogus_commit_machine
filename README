How to make this work:
1. Put the python script and proof.txt in the same folder
2. Create a cron job as follows:
- Suppose we want the script to run every five minutes
- So in a shell, run the following:

$> crontab -e
# The cronjob list will now open (use your editor of choice)

# add this _exactly_ to the end of the list (make sure there is a blank line at eof)
*/5 * * * * cd <path_to_script>; python bogus.py >> /tmp/bogus_log.txt
# The logging is optional but it's helpful for diagnostics

Once the cron tab is running, sit back and watch your commit graph grow. :--)
